              This is a quintessential book. No other work of literature
              has the same effect: owing to the ambiguity of the Ancient
              Chinese language it was written in, every single translation of this book 
              is different; yet each translation seems to carry the 
              same essential message, while still bringing forth something novel
              from each translator. <br />
              <br />
              Owing to the subtlety and ambiguity of the language, this book 
              requires a certain readjustment in one's expectations about it,
              indeed about reality itself.
              It is something that grows with you; every time I revisit it, it's
              as if I read something new. But this itself is testimonial of this 
              work's alignment with its essential metaphysical message of the Tao:
              like the uncarved block or unbleached silk (in Zen metaphors),
              its absence of well-defined and constrained form allows it to 
              draw novel forms from everyone who encounters it.<br />

            <p className="bookshelf-list-item-desc">
              This obscure work, assembled from whatever was left of 
              the intellectual output of the Ancient Greek philosopher
              Heraclitus, is similar to the Tao Te Ching in many respects.
              Heraclitus is my favorite philosopher of the Western canon for
              exactly this reason; the constrained and random nature of the
              fragments that remain of his work force the reader to 
              contemplate, drawing novel interpretations not so much from the 
              text as from their own mind. <br /><br />
              Heraclitus is also one of the few Western philosophers who
              apprehended the <i>unity of opposites</i>. This is a concept
              discovered by the Ancient Chinese, notoriously represented in the
              yin-yang symbol. It is a concept that is so essential and fundamental
              to the nature of reality that it escapes most of us. Alan Watts,
              my favorite philosopher of the 20th century, called it the only 
              metaphysical lesson one needs to learn: that all fronts
              come with backs, and all ups come with downs. Quoting
              Heraclitus' 60th fragment, "The way up and the way down is one and the same."  <br /><br />

                I Ching

            <p className="bookshelf-list-item-desc">
              This is one of the more esoteric books on this list.
              It's not so much a book as it is a divination tool, though it
              is also well worth reading for its own sake. It is also known as the Book of Changes,
              indeed change is the most central theme of this book. <br /><br />
              The logic of the I Ching is broadly as follows. You choose a question
              about your present circumstances, and then using some method of randomization,
              you generate a hexagram (consisting of six lines, each of which can be either 
              broken (yin) or unbroken (yang)). You then look up the hexagram in the book,
              and read the corresponding text. In the text you will find 
              a broad, very vague description of something, which you
              then project an interpretation into about the question
              you asked. It is thus a tool for exercising, in a 
              certain sense externalizing one's intuition.<br /><br />
              The link above in the title takes you to a website where you 
              can cast virtual coins to generate a hexagram if you want to try it out.

            <p className="bookshelf-list-item-desc">
              This is a collection of five books on the nature of randomness and uncertainty: <i>Fooled by Randomness</i>, <i>The Black Swan</i>, <i>The Bed of Procrustes</i>, <i>Antifragile</i> and <i>Skin in the Game</i>. <br></br>
              They are all worth reading; Taleb is a very entertaining writer, 
              and he does not fear to state his observations strongly (I find him 
              much more palatable when I only pay attention to his written work, 
              as opposed to his Twitter account). <br /><br /> 
              A particular favorite of mine is the collection of aphorisms that is 
              <i> The Bed of Procrustes</i>. Aphoristic writing requires an ability
              to condense a lot of meaning into a few words; it is a great way to practice
              not only the art of writing but also that of thinking.

              This is an extraordinary book about the phenomenon of self-reference,
              something which seems to be an unescapable feature of reality as 
              well as consciousness of it. Though it is a long and at times very challenging
              read, it is also very entertaining and delightful.

            <p className="bookshelf-list-item-author">Robert Breedlove</p>
            <p className="bookshelf-list-item-desc">
              This is an essay by Robert Breedlove, a Bitcoin philosopher and
              entrepreneur. What makes it great is that even if you couldn't
              care less about Bitcoin (though he makes very compelling cases for it),
              it is an extremely insightful essay about the concept of emptiness.
              <br /><br />
              Emptiness is something I find extraordinarily essential to contemplate,
              and it is a shame that in the Western intellectual canon it has been
              completely misunderstood. It is a peculiar expression of our intellectual
              domain-dependence (in the West) that we could without much problems apprehend the concept
              of zero in mathematics; but in our philosophy we have been blind to the 
              very same metaphysical thing. Though it should be said that the concept
              of zero originated in India, in the very same intellectual tradition
              which birthed Buddhism as well as its conception of <i>sunyata</i> (emptiness);
               and we only got to it later on through inheriting the 
              numeral system that the people of India invented. <br /><br />
